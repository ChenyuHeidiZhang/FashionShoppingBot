# FashionShoppingBot

This project is a fashion shopping bot that helps you retrieve clothes you want across different clothing websites.

To run this project, first create a virtual environment with python==3.7, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
(Notably, you would need faiss-cpu, sentence-transformer, and torchvision packages.)

To start the interactive retrieval shell, run
`python retrieve.py` \\
and you will be prompted to enter a search text or an image for search.
